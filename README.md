# TheFappyBirdGame
The fappy bird game is a fast coded (few hours of work) Flappy bird like game, developped in Python 3, using the cross platform framework [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#home).

The aim of this project is totally undefined but I'd like to add features such as a screen where you'll be able to add your avatar (by taking a picture of you?) and defeat your friends.
